# gamelad

A work-in-progress editor theme limited to the greens of the original Nintendo Game Boy. Created using [the thTheme-Editor app](https://tmtheme-editor.herokuapp.com/).

Created originally for RStudio users playing [{safar6}](https://github.com/matt-dray/safar6), an R package that lets you play a simplified, simulated version of [the Safari Zone](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Kanto_Safari_Zone) sub-area from _Pok√©mon Blue_ in your console.

To install the theme for RStudio, you can run:

``` r
theme_url <- 
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matt-dray/gamelad/main/gamelad.rstheme"

rstudioapi::addTheme(theme_url, apply = TRUE)
```
